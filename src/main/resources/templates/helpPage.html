    <h3>Most frequently asked questions</h3>
    <div>
        1. Should I get an iPhone or an Android?<br>
        App developers often release their products on iOS first, sometimes exclusively, so that could make iPhone a more attractive choice.
        It is better to hands-on test a smartphone before forking over any cash.
        <br><br>
        2. What do I look out for in a phone?<br>
        How you plan to use your phone will determine how fully featured it should be.
        Do you plan to use it as an all-in-one calling, texting, scheduling and entertainment center?
        Will you capture lots of voice memos, videos and pictures with it?
        If so, then consider a top-shelf smartphone, like an Apple iPhone 5s, a Nokia Lumia 928, Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One or LG Nexus 4.
        How big the price tag is depends on how big the screen is, how much data the phone can store, plus how high-res its camera is, how fast its processors are and how long its battery lasts.
        <br><br>
        3. How much internal storage should I look for?<br>
        This feature depends entirely on what youâ€™re interested in storing on your phone. However, a good ballpark figure to aim for is 16GB.
        Since there are some games that can occupy 1GB alone, this figure should be taken only as a base value.
        32GB phones are much more efficient, and if that does not work out there is always the option of a micro SD. The latter is probably another key feature you should look out for.
        <br><br>
        4. Why can't I connect to Wi-Fi?<br>
            1) Make sure your phone is running on the latest operating system by navigating to Settings > General > Software Update and check to see if you need to update.<br>
            2) Make sure something hasn't gone awry with your Wi-Fi by resetting your network settings. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings.<br>
            3) Make sure your Wi-Fi is turned on and flight mode off.<br>
            4) Make sure that you're trying to connect to the right Wi-Fi network, and that you have the correct password. If your phone has connected but nothing will load, you can try refreshing your connection to the network.<br>
            5) If none of this works, you might need to restart your Wi-Fi router. You can usually do this by simply unplugging it for ten seconds and then plugging it back in. It'll take a moment to restart, then will begin broadcasting its signal again.<br>
